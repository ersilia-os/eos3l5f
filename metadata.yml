Title: CLAMP contrastive molecule pretraining embedding
Description: CLAMP is a model trained on molecule-assay pairs, using assay descriptions
  as text. The current model returns the CLAMP embedding, trained on ChEMBL data (FS-Mol).
  Therefore, contrastive learning is used to learn chemical representations with awareness
  of a large-scale bioactivity dataset.
